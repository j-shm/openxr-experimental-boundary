# Open XR Experimental Boundary

This project aims to replicate the quest's experimental boundary setting: [Video of person using quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t1CdmDeBhA)
The main focus is to allow this to be used on any openxr setup therefore proprietary software should not be used unless it is needed for a specific export.

## Requirements
The following and their dependencies are required for the project:
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) (Made on 2021.3.27f1)
- [Newtonsoft Json](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@2.0/manual/index.html) 
- [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.3/manual/index.html) + sample assets

XR Interaction Toolkit is not nessacary if you are only using the package for loading already made boundaries in

These should be installed when you open this unity project apart from sample assets.
